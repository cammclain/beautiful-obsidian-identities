# Beautiful Obsidian Identities

> A fork of @seth10 [beautiful-obsidian-contacts](https://github.com/seth10/beautiful-obsidian-contacts) 

## Goal:

I like the original project's way of displaying the contacts as rendered markdown, but I want to add additional fields for platforms that are relevant to my vaults.

I will also be revising the overall focus of the original project, which is to provide a visually appealing way to document and present a person's contact information.

The new focus will be on providing a way to document, and present the information you have gathered on an individual or identity/alias a threat actor could be using, etc. 

The revised focus aims to provide quality of life improvements for documenting various osint investigations via obsidian
